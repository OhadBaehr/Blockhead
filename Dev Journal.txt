To-Do
======
> Aux hair textures aren't being routed correctly
	>> Need to patch another location
> Fix EGT path overriding for body textures
	>> Patch path at 0x0052D68C (and stuff at 0x0052D5AF)
> Investigate race body textures being read from the model's texturing prop
	>> 0x0052D5AF and beyond
> BodyOverride::FixPlayerBody screws up the first person bow anims when the PC's crouched (and random CTDs)
	>> Remove it altogether and add a note in the readMe about the body mesh issue, it's too much trouble 
> Set/GetFaceGenComplexion
